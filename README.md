- Lab data for book: [Spatial analysis theory and practice : describe - explore - explain](www.cambridge.org/9781108498982)

- BackUpData folder stores the original data and serves as the backup of the data stored in the folder Data. In case of corrupted, accidentally deleted or wrongly edited data, you should copy the dataset from the BackUpData folder and paste it into the Data folder.
- Each subsequent folder (e.g., Lab1) stores the .mxd files for each specific lab and the Output and Solved folders.
- The Output folder is used to save the output files of your analysis, like shapefiles, graphs, pdf or images. This is the main folder of your data analysis.
- The Solved folder provides the solved exercise along with the final dataset after any tools applied and editing. Use this folder to compare with your results.
- An additional folder, GeoDa, is used only in exercises solved with GeoDa software.

Software used: ArcGIS 10.4, GeoDa 1.12, Matlab R2016a
